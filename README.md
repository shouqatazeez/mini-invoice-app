**A full-stack invoice management system for small businesses, freelancers, and service providers.**

I built InvoTrack because small businesses and freelancers often manage customers, invoices, payments, and tax calculations manually — in WhatsApp messages and Excel sheets. They forget who paid, who has pending payment, and what the monthly revenue is.

InvoTrack gives them one simple system: add customers, create invoices with automatic tax and discount calculations, track payment status, download branded PDF invoices, and see everything at a glance on a clean dashboard.

## The Problem

Every small business owner, tuition teacher, freelancer, and repair shop deals with:

- Forgetting who paid and who didn't
- Manually calculating tax, discounts, and totals
- No professional invoices to send customers
- No overview of monthly revenue vs pending payments
- Managing everything in WhatsApp groups or messy spreadsheets

InvoTrack solves all of this with a clean billing dashboard that takes 2 minutes to set up.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Add Your Products/Services
Define what you charge for — "Math Tuition ₹500", "Laptop Repair ₹2000", "Web Design ₹15000". Set it once, use it forever when creating invoices.

### 2. Add Your Customers
Store customer details — name, email, phone, address. Only the name is required. Add more details later.

### 3. Create an Invoice
Pick a customer, add line items (select products, set quantity), apply tax rate and discount. The app calculates subtotal, tax amount, and final total automatically.

### 4. Track & Download
Mark invoices as Paid, Unpaid, or Overdue. Download a branded PDF invoice to share with customers via WhatsApp or email. Dashboard shows revenue, pending, and overdue amounts at a glance.

## Use Cases

**A tuition teacher with 20 students**
She adds each student as a customer, creates monthly invoices for "Math Tuition x 4 classes = ₹2000", downloads the PDF, and sends it on WhatsApp. When they pay via UPI, she marks it PAID. End of month — dashboard shows exactly how much she earned vs what's still pending.

**A freelance web developer**
He creates invoices for each project milestone — "Frontend Development ₹25000 + Backend API ₹15000 + Tax 18%". Downloads a professional PDF to email the client. Tracks which clients have overdue payments.

**A laptop repair shop**
Walk-in customer needs a repair. Owner creates a quick invoice: "Screen Replacement x 1 = ₹5000 + GST 18%". Prints or WhatsApps the PDF. Marks it paid when customer pays.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) | Full-stack React with API routes, server components |
| Language | TypeScript 5 | Type safety, catches bugs at compile time |
| Database | PostgreSQL (Neon) | Cloud-native, serverless-compatible |
| ORM | Prisma 7 | Type-safe database queries, easy migrations |
| Auth | NextAuth 4 (JWT) | Session management, credential provider |
| UI | shadcn/ui + Radix UI | Accessible, customizable component library |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 4 | Utility-first, fast iteration |
| PDF | jsPDF | Client-side PDF generation |
| Icons | Lucide React | Consistent, lightweight icon set |
| Deployment | Vercel | Zero-config Next.js deployment |

## Database Schema

```
User (id, email, password, name)
  └── has many → Customer (id, name, email, phone, address, userId)
  └── has many → Product (id, name, description, price, userId)
  └── has many → Invoice (id, invoiceNumber, status, subtotal, taxRate, taxAmount, discount, total, userId, customerId)
                    └── has many → InvoiceItem (id, quantity, price, total, invoiceId, productId)
```

**Key design decisions:**
- Every entity has a `userId` foreign key — ensures complete data isolation between users
- Invoice status is an enum: PAID, UNPAID, OVERDUE
- Invoice items cascade delete when invoice is deleted
- Invoice number auto-generates as INV-001, INV-002 per user
